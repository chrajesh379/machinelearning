Simple Linear Regression
  y^ = b0+b1*X1
  y^ is dependant variable
  X1 is independant variable
  b0 is y-intercept(constant)
  b1 is slope coefficent
Ex: Predcting output of potataos in the farm based on the amount of Nutrozen fertiliser used
  pototas = b0+b1*Fertilizer[kg]
  b0 = 8tons
  b1 = 3tons/kg ( If you increase of Nitrozen fertilizer 1 kg then the potatatos will increase 3 tons)
