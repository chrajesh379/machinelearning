Simple Linear Regression:
  Estabilish a relationship between two variables . 
  Postitive relationship -> If one increses other variable values increases
  Negative relationship -> If one decreases other variables values increases
  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owI7zxCqNY0) 
  y^ = b0+b1*X1
  y^ is dependant variable
  X1 is independant variable
  b0 is y-intercept(constant)
  b1 is slope coefficent
  Ex: Predcting output of potataos in the farm based on the amount of Nutrozen fertiliser used
    pototas = b0+b1*Fertilizer[kg]
    b0 = 8tons
    b1 = 3tons/kg ( If you increase of Nitrozen fertilizer 1 kg then the potatatos will increase 3 tons)
  Ordinary Least Squares:
   To identify which of the slope line is the best one, we will use Rodinaly Least Sqaures
   Project the datalines with the Regression line
   yi is actual values
   yi^ is what is the linear regression predicts
   residual = (yi-yi^)
   the best equestion is 
   y^ = b0+b1*X1 
   b0 and b1 such that sum(yi-yi^)power of 2 is minimum
