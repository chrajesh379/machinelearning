What is statistics?
  Collecting, organizing and analyzing the data for better decision making
Types of Statistics:
  1. Descriptive Stats: It consists of organizing and sumarrizing the data
      Ex: What is the average marks of students in a class?
  2. Inferential Stats: Techiniques where we used the data to measure the conclusions 
      Ex: Are the marks of the students of this classromm similar to the marks  maths classroom 

Sample and Population:
Sample is subset of population
Sampling will have multiple techiniques.
  1. Simple Random Sampling: Randomly pick the samples. Used in many of the scenarios. Every member of the population has equal chance of being selected. 
  2. Stratified Sampling: Where the population is split into non overlapping groups. Ex: Gender -> male and Female
  3. Systematics Sampling: Nth individual. Ex: Taking the survey for every 8th person.
  4. Convience Sampling : Only those people who are expert speficic to that domain 
  5. 
Variables:
Quantitative variables: These are like numarical variables. 
  1. Descrte variables: Ex: Number of childeren, number of bank accounts etc: We will not have floating values.
  2. Continuis variables: Ex: Height, Weight , Tempature  etc.
Categorical variables:
  Ex: Gender, states etc
Variable manage techniques:
  1. Nominal Data : Categorical data
  2. oridnal Data : Order of the data is the matters
  3. Interval Dara: Order and values matters

Frequencey Distribution:
Sample Data sets : Rose, lilly,sunflower, rose, lilly, sunflower, lilly,rose, lilly
Rose: 3
Lilly - 4
Sunflower : 2
Cumative is 3+4+2 =9 

Bar chart is used for represent descrete values, and Histogram is used to represent Continous values
